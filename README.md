## Deployment

### **To deploy the project**
This site was deployed using the Github Pages platform. To deploy a site with Pages one must:
 1. In Github's repository, navigate to the **Settings** tab.
 2. Once in the Settings, move to the **Pages** tab in the left-hand navigation column.
 3. Under the **Branch** selector, select the **main** option and the **root** folder, then click **save**.
 4. The site will automatically deploy and a green complete banner will indicate success.

### **To fork the repository**
 A copy of the page can be done through forking the Github account. This copy can be viewed and changed without modifying the original. To fork the repository one must:
  1. Log in to **GitHub** and locate the [repository]
  2. Select the **fork** option in the top right hand corner of the page to create a copy of the repository.


### **To create a local clone**

  1. Select the **code** tab from the repository's navigation bar.
  2. Choose the **clone** option in the secondary navigation bar and copy the url provided.
  3. In your IDE of your choice open **Git Bash**
  4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  5. Type **git clone**, and then paste the URL copied from GitHub.
  6. Confirm the choice and the local clone will be created.
