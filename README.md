Website presents Yoel's portfolio-1 project for a Personal trainer.

## Issues found during site development

* #### Footer not staying at the bottom of the screen in mobile devices
![testing_issue_1](images/Screenshot_2022-05-03_at_11.20.57.png?raw=true)

When displaying the website on mobile devices, my footer would move to the middle of the screen instead of staying at the bottom, blocking important elements and damaging the overall user experience.

> I fixed it by wrapping the whole page in a div that would act as a container, then setting it's minimum height to 100% of the viewport (vh) and giving it a position of relative. As it is relative it's child elements (In this case the footer) could be set with absolute position based on it.

> Then I set the footer position to absolute, sticking to the bottom:0 



* #### Form in Contact Page being out of place in mobile devices

![testing_issue_1](images/Screenshot_2022-05-03_at_11.59.47.png?raw=true)

When displayed on mobile devices the form in the contact page would look out of placed and misaligned

> I fixed this by adding a media querie that would add an additional padding of 300px when the height of the screen dropped to below 1200px (Tablets and mobile devices).

> I also had to set the top margin to 0 as it was pushing the whole div downwards

> This pushes the form to a more centred position therefore improving user experience, below the solution:

@media screen and (max-width:1200px) {

.contact {
  padding-top: 300px;
  margin-top: 0;
    
  }



## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do several changes to improve performance, specially replacing images for lighter formats such as .webp which improved the performance significantly. Screenshots are presented below:



Final results:
![performance_final](images/Screenshot_2022-05-03_at_14.08.14.png?raw=true)

I noticed that this tests scores vary from time to time and depends on external libraries as well. 



## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate my code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS


 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
